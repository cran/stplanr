\usage{
weightfield(x)

weightfield(x, varname) <- value

weightfield(x, varname) <- value

\S4method{weightfield}{SpatialLinesNetwork}(x)

\S4method{weightfield}{SpatialLinesNetwork,ANY}(x) <- value

\S4method{weightfield}{SpatialLinesNetwork,character}(x, varname) <- value
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{SpatialLinesNetwork to use}

\item{varname}{The name of the variable to set/use.}

\item{value}{Either the name of the variable to use as the weight field or
a dataframe or vector containing the weights to use if \code{varname} is
passed to the replacement function. If the dataframe contains multiple
columns, the column with the same name as \code{varname} is used,
otherwise the first column is used.}

\description{
Get or set value of weight field in SpatialLinesNetwork
}
\section{Details}{

These functions manipulate the value of weightfield in a
SpatialLinesNetwork. When changing the value of weightfield, the weights
of the graph network are updated with the values of the corresponding
variables.

\examples{
data(routes_fast)
rnet <- overline(sldf = routes_fast, attrib = "length")
SLN <- SpatialLinesNetwork(rnet)
weightfield(SLN) <- 'length'
weightfield(SLN, 'randomnum') <- sample(1:10, size = nrow(SLN@sl), replace = TRUE)
