----------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* Interface to the Google Distance Matrix `API with dist_google`.

* New transport planning API added, with `route_transportapi_public` (for testing).

* Update to `line2route`, allowing it to accept different routing funtions via the new argument `route_fun` (for testing - tested with `route_fun = route_cyclestreet`).

* New functions for creating origin-destination data frames (`point2odf`) and SpatialLinesDataFrames (`points2flow`).

* Addition of `n_vertices` and `is_linepoint` for identifying the number of vertices in spatial objects and whether the 'line' is really a point.

BUG FIXES

* `line2route` refactored, with 10 fold speed increases on large (1000+) batches of lines.
